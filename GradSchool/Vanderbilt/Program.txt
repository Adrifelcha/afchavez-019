-> All graduate students are required to serve as a TA for at least 2 
  semesters, and many serve more depending on the student’s goals and 
  laboratory. 


FINNANCIAL SUPPORT

Every student is admitted with funding that includes a 9 month stipend, 
tuition remission, and health insurance. 

Funding sources include fellowships, teaching assistantships, research 
assistantships, training grants, and individual predoctoral fellowships. 

Students are often funded from a variety of sources during their graduate
careers. Students who remain in good standing are guaranteed funding for 
five years. 

While summer support is not guaranteed, most graduate students receive 
some kind of support during the summer months. We also strongly encourage
all graduate students to apply for their own external support from NSF, 
NIH, NSRC, and other agencies.

Over-and-above these awards, monies are usually available for 
professional development, research equipment, and travel to conferences.
